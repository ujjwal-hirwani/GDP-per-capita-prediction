# GDP per capita prediction
The project aims to utilize machine learning techniques for forecasting GDP per capita, a crucial indicator of economic prosperity. GDP per capita reflects the average income earned per person in a country and serves as a key measure of living standards and economic development. By leveraging historical GDP data along with a wide range of economic, social, and demographic factors, the machine learning model can generate forecasts that help policymakers, investors, and businesses understand and anticipate future economic trends.
